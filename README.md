# Player Performance

So basically just going to predict player's Form performance for our blog article in here...

Starting with a few good CS:GO players. They are:

* GeT_RiGhT
* Guardian
* Snax (Le Snax)

Now we are going to be using an LSTM to do this through Keras (which is an easy to use neural network package) running through python and Theano. There is a fair bit of preprocessing, which is done in the accompanying notebook and covered by our article.
